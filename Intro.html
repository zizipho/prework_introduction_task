          <h1 class="welcome">Welcome to Zizi's Introduction Page</h1>

          <p class="hello">Hello, my name is Zizipho. A 22 year old female originally from the Eastern Cape but I grew up in the mother city,in a high crime rated township called Khayelitsha. Hoping that one day I will be able to move out to a more safe and nice place somewhere in the suburbs. I'll walk you through a bit about my education and work life. </p> 

          

               <h2 class="education">Education</h2>

                <p>I did both my primary and high school years in the townships, its called keeping it localðŸ˜…. 
                    My <em>passion</em> for software development was born and bred back in high school, the Centre of Science and Technology, where I was introduced to Information Technology as a subject. From there I went to CapaCiti then EDSA, to enhance and refine my personal development throughout the two courses.</p>

    <h2>The work environment</h2>
    <p>My first job, I was working for a procurement company and also assisting with office duties. I then worked for a big company,Telkom in Centurion (Pretoria) as a campaign analyst intern. 
        I was excited and scared at the same time, to leave home and go to another province for the first time where I didn't even know anyone.I guess in life you just have to take risks and be out of your comfort zone. 
        I must say I had the <strong>best</strong> time in Pretoria, as much as I felt the pressure of being in a corporate environment but I grasped some knowledge and gained experience.
         The last job I got was from aYo Holdings, as a data scientist intern. That was an <strong>awesome</strong> environment to ever work in and hey, I also got to travel with the big bosses to JHB for meetingsðŸ”¥, but the then again the aim is to add on to the little knowledge that you have. So I've learnt a lot there. </p>
    
    <h2>Things I want to achieve out of this course:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ability to code from the heart/mind</li>
        <li>Be able to solve real life problems</li>
        <li>Creativity through programming</li>
        <li>Get a job</li>
      </ul>
